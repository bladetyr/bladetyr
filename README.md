### Welcome :]
Hi, I'm Blade! I'm a (former) senior computer science student with a concentration in cybersecurity. I also used to teach Python to college students. I am now a current software engineer who makes a lot of scripts and data visualization tools. If you're here, you'll find a lot of my for-fun repositories with some old classwork mixed in. I try to make all of my work accessible for as many people as possible. If there's anything I can do to make my software or websites more accessible to you, please feel free to open an issue in the repo; I'd be happy to fix it up.

My personal blog site is [here](https://bladetyr.neocities.org/).

## üí° I'm working on...
Refreshing myself on ReactJS! I want to make some portfolio sites for my friends!! I've also been making some webscraping tooling for another friend of mine to download some old art they have stored online.
