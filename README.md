### Welcome :]
Hi, I'm Blade! I'm a senior computer science student with a concentration in cybersecurity. If you're here, you'll find a lot of my for-fun repositories with some classwork mixed in. I try to make all of my work accessible for as many people as possible. If there's anything I can do to make my software or websites more accessible to you, please feel free to open an issue on the repo; I'd be happy to fix it up.

My business site/resume is [here](https://bladetyr.github.io/) and my personal blog site is [here](https://bladetyr.neocities.org/).

## 💡 I'm working on...
Raycasting! I'll link the repo here when I'm ready to make a commit.
