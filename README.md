### Welcome :]
Hi, I'm Blade! I'm a (former) senior computer science student with a concentration in cybersecurity. If you're here, you'll find a lot of my for-fun repositories with some classwork mixed in. I try to make all of my work accessible for as many people as possible. If there's anything I can do to make my software or websites more accessible to you, please feel free to open an issue in the repo; I'd be happy to fix it up.

My business site/resume is [here](https://bladetyr.github.io/) and my personal blog site is [here](https://bladetyr.neocities.org/).

## 💡 I'm working on...
A break! I have just graduated and am in the process of moving. I'll hopefully be doing more fun dev stuff soon :D
